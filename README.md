Official implementation for TPAMI 2024 paper "Instance Consistency Regularization for Semi-Supervised 3D Instance Segmentation".

The code is under preparation and is coming soon.

This work is based on our base 3D instance segmentation model [DKNet](https://github.com/W1zheng/DKNet). You can review this repository first.
